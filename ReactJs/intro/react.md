# why React ?
- We can Use states which means that once we update the variable, it changes across the states
- we can split our app into multiple components and reuse those components
- React uses a virtual DOM to efficiently update the UI which is better that updating content using DOM Manipulation 
- Debugging and maintenance is easy
